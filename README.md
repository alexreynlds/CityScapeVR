# Cityscape VR

Cityscape VR is a virtual reality experience created in the Unity engine that I made for a univeristy VR module.

The experience is relatively simple and just allows the user to walk around a small section of a city, including cars, padestirans and ambient sounds.

A quick demonstation video can be found here: https://youtu.be/4Ca-nDxs9DA?si=TWi1oZIRSIxSzIzF

I wish to come back to this project one day and add a lot more too it because I really enjoy working with VR.
